Introduction
Deepfake detection is the process of identifying synthetic media in which a person in an existing image or video is replaced with someone else's likeness. This project uses a machine learning model to detect such deepfake images.

Features
Upload and analyze images for deepfakes
RESTful API endpoints using FastAPI
Easy setup and deployment
Setup and Installation
Clone the repository:

sh
git clone https://github.com/VIKASSAMVEL/deepfake-detection.git
cd deepfake-detection
Create a virtual environment:

sh
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required dependencies:

sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the FastAPI server:

sh
uvicorn main:app --reload
Usage
Start the FastAPI server:

sh
uvicorn main:app --reload
Upload an image: Use any API client (e.g., Postman) or the built-in FastAPI docs at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs to upload an image and get the detection results.

Analyze the results: The API will return a JSON response indicating whether the image is a deepfake or not.
